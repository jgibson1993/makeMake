This utility is the first I'm writing for myself, I'm frankly sick of having to write out makefiles
every time I try and write a program, so I'm making a thing that will (hopefully) simply produce
makefiles for me

#USAGE:
	makeMake [Executable name]

##with switches:
*	-db		setup separate rules for building debug versions of things, debug default
*	-bd		ditto on above, but build is default
*	-r		sets up folders for sources, objects and dependencies, writes default rules accordingly
*	-w		creates the makefile ensuring that the resulting executable from the build rule doesn't open a cmd window
			(meaningless if either -db or -bd aren't specified)

##Notes:
The "depClean" rule removes ALL dependency information generated by g++, only use this rule if you know
that that's what you need to do (for instance, you only have one file that no longer depends on a header)

In most cases, a simple clean will fix these problems just as well and won't cause any strangeness in the
way of files no longer being remade when their headers change
